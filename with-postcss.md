```

## Usage

In `postcss.config.js`:

```js
const purgecss = require('@fullhuman/postcss-purgecss')

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    purgecss({
      content: ['./**/*.html']
    })
  ]
}
```

Using PostCSS API:

See [PostCSS] docs for examples for your environment.

## Options

All of the options of PurgeCSS are available to use with the plugins.
You will find below the main options available. For the complete list, go to the [PurgeCSS documentation website](https://www.purgecss.com/configuration.html#options).

### `content` (**required**)
Type: `string | Object`

You can specify content that should be analyzed by PurgeCSS with an array of filenames or globs. The files can be HTML, Pug, Blade, etc.

### `extractors`
Type: `Array<Object>`

PurgeCSS can be adapted to suit your needs. If you notice a lot of unused CSS is not being removed, you might want to use a custom extractor.
More information about extractors [here](https://www.purgecss.com/extractors.html).

### `whitelist`
Type: `Array<string>`

You can whitelist selectors to stop PurgeCSS from removing them from your CSS. This can be accomplished with the options whitelist and whitelistPatterns.

### `whitelistPatterns`
Type: `Array<RegExp>`

You can whitelist selectors based on a regular expression with whitelistPatterns.

### `keyframes`
Type: `boolean`
Default value: `false`

If you are using a CSS animation library such as animate.css, you can remove unused keyframes by setting the keyframes option to true.

#### `fontFace`
Type: `boolean`
Default value: `false`

If there are any unused @font-face rules in your css, you can remove them by setting the fontFace option to true.
